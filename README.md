Real Time emotion detection using python's deepface library
Facial Detection and recognition research has been widely studied in recent years. Facial
recognition applications play an important role in many areas such as security, camera
surveillance, identity verification in modern electronic devices, criminal investigations,
database management systems, smart card applications, etc. This work presents deep learning
algorithms used in facial recognition for accurate identification and detection. The main
objective of facial recognition is to authenticate and identify facial features. However, the facial
features are captured in real-time and processed using haar-cascade detection. The sequential
process of the work is defined in three different phases where in the first phase human face is
detected by the camera and in the second phase, the captured input is analyzed based on the
features and database used with the support of Keras convolutional neural network model. In
the last phase, the human face is authenticated to classify the emotions of human as happy,
neutral, angry, sad, disgust and surprise. The proposed work presented is simplified into three
objectives as face detection, recognition, and emotion classification. In support of this work
Open CV library, dataset, and python programming is used for the computer vision techniques
involved. To prove real-time efficacy, an experiment was conducted for multiple students to
identify their inner emotions and find physiological changes in each face. The results of the
experiments demonstrate the perfections in the face analysis system. Finally, the performance
of automatic face detection and recognition is measured with Accuracy
